  <p> European colonialism and colonization was the policy or practice of acquiring full or partial political control over other societies and territories, founding a colony, occupying it with settlers, and exploiting it economically. Research suggests, the current conditions of postcolonial countries have roots in colonial actions and policies. For example, colonial policies, such as the type of rule implemented, the nature of investments,and identity of the colonizers, are cited as impacting postcolonial states. Examination of the state-building process, economic development, and cultural norms and mores shows the direct and indirect consequences of colonialism on the postcolonial states.</p>
  <h4>progressive colonial structures</h4>

  <p>After many years of political independence in most African nations, claims that Africa should depend on imported economic development models for it develop leaves much be desired. It appears for Zambia the imported economic models have brought misery and poverty for most citizens. The models have given advantage to the west at the expediency of developing countries in terms of impetus for economic growth in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In addition, globalization process is a major trend both now and in the future as it spans opportunities and risks in many countries. </p>
  <p>postindependence authoritarianism in Africa can be understood as an institutional legacy of late colonialism. However, connections to colonial times did exist in the frames of legitimation that underpinned the frequently authoritarian actions of the postindependence . One such connection was the persistent paternalism  subjects that characterized the political imagination of state elites; another was the fact that "the colonial past" served as an important reference point in the construction of a deeply Manichean discourse and practice of politics after independence.

<h4>unprogessive colonial structures</h4>
<p>As historiography, this view had a number of basic flaws. It was morally and empirically one‐sided, taking little account of the complaints coming from the governed or the criticisms from British scholars of the Left; it exaggerated not just the empire's beneficence but its power and influence upon the colonized; it had no place for the agency of these colonized people themselves; and it treated the long centuries before British arrival as unimportant and irrelevant.</p>
  <p>Colonial powers justified their conquests by asserting that they had a legal and religious obligation to take over the land and culture of indigenous peoples</p> <br>
<h4>meaning of life</h4>
<img src="images/img1.jpg" height="200" width="200">
  <p>Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance.<br>It is well known that humor, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds. … The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living. Yet it is possible to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp, although suffering is omnipresent.<br>man does have a choice of action. … Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress.</p>

  <p>understand the importance of social distancing by sharing or exploring reliable sources of information. Take time to discuss things they can do to feel more connected to their peers through remote means. For younger teens, this may mean relaxing some of your restrictions on social media use. Explore new apps and tools that can facilitate group chats and video connection so they can stay connected to their peers. These may include House Party, Google Meet, Facetime and Skype. While you don’t want to encourage them to be on their electronic devices all the time, it is important to recognize the critical role of socialization and connection to peers. <br></p>
